# 📘 Git & GitHub Notes (Based on CodeWithHarry Playlist)

These are my personal notes that I took while learning Git and GitHub using the YouTube playlist by [CodeWithHarry](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwhy658ZPA0MTStKUJTWPi&si=nl2dDiND-jjG4iao).  
The playlist is 5 years old but still extremely relevant. It covers all the fundamentals using Git Bash (which might feel outdated), but it’s one of the most underrated and solid tutorials on YouTube.

To get more comfortable with the modern way of using Git (especially with VS Code), I also watched one additional lecture from [Apna College](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w?si=Zo2_326Ci1EqR8-B). Most of the concepts were already covered, but it added a few updated insights.
